## The Opener

**"What do you like seeing in your yard?"**

Listen. Then connect their answer to what we do.

| They say... | You say... |
|-------------|------------|
| Herbs | "We can help your basil actually taste like something" |
| Fruit trees | "Fruit trees are hungry - compost is what they need" |
| Sunflowers | "You want tall? This is how you get tall" |
| Vines | "Those need specific nutrients to look that good" |
| Birds/butterflies | "Native plants fed with compost = more pollinators" |
| "I don't really garden" | "That's fine - you can gift your share to a neighbor who does" |

## Three Strongest Points

1. **Your scraps stay local** - Turns into compost 500 feet away, not a landfill 50 miles away

2. **You get a soil partner** - We pay attention to your yard, understand your soil, and help you grow what you want

3. **You're paying a neighbor kid** - Not a corporation, a local teen building real skills

---

## The Value Prop

**Don't say:** "We take your trash"

**Say:** "For $25/month you get a soil partner who pays attention to your yard"

## Common Objections

### "Why would I care where my scraps go?"

Your food waste in a landfill creates methane - 20x worse than CO2. One gallon of scraps in your bucket instead of the trash is like taking a 300-mile car trip off the road.

But honestly? Most people don't think about it. Here's what they do notice: no rotting food smell in your trash can all week.

### "I don't garden - what would I do with compost?"

A few options:
- **Houseplants** - herbs, vines, anything green inside
- **Gift it** - sponsor a neighbor's garden, it's a great gift
- **Skip it** - keep your price the same, we'll sell it to someone who wants it

You're still sequestering carbon either way.

### "What if you guys quit halfway through?"

It's a co-op, not one kid. There's always someone to cover. And we're local - if something's wrong, you know exactly where to find us.

### "I don't want teenagers on my property every week"

We stay at the curb. Bucket out, bucket back. You don't have to see us.

**Invisibility option:** We'll text you before we start our run. Leave your bucket out, we swap it for a clean one that night. Zero interaction if you prefer.

### "Is this even a real business?"

Real equipment, real training, real accountability. We're just not a corporation taking a cut. Every dollar stays in the neighborhood.

## The Environmental Close

(For people who care about this)

"Every gallon you put in that bucket instead of the trash is one less car trip's worth of methane. 300 miles of driving - that's your food scraps rotting in a landfill versus becoming soil here."

---

## The Gift Angle

"If you don't want the compost yourself, give it to someone who does. Sponsor a neighbor's garden. You choose where it goes. You're still sequestering carbon either way."

---

## The Service Pitch

"Being a member means your yard gets particular attention. We learn what your soil needs, what you're trying to grow, and how to help. $25/month and your food waste - that's it."

## Handling "Maybe Later"

Get their contact info. Ask:

- "When would be a good time to check back - spring when you're thinking about your garden?"
- "Want me to text you when we have our first batch of compost ready? You can see what it looks like."

Follow up once. If no response, move on.

## Who to Target First

1. **People with gardens visible from the street** - they already care
2. **Natural lawns** (no ChemLawn signs) - eco-minded, better materials for us
3. **Neighbors you already know** - warm intro beats cold knock
4. **Friends' parents** - easy yes to build confidence
