# Governance & Legal Structure

## Mission

**Build soil, build skills, build community.**

Turn neighborhood waste into garden gold while teaching youth regenerative land stewardship.

## Structure: Worker Co-op

A worker-owned cooperative where profits go back to members (workers), not external shareholders.

### Why Co-op (not Nonprofit)

| Question | Co-op | Nonprofit 501(c)(3) |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Can members get paid well? | Yes - that's the point | Limited, must be "reasonable" |
| Where do profits go? | Back to members | Must stay in organization |
| Who controls it? | Members vote | Board (may not include workers) |
| Tax-deductible donations? | No | Yes |
| Complexity to form? | Moderate | High |

We want youth earning $50+/hr. That's a co-op.

## Governance Phases

### Phase 1: Founder-Controlled (Now)

**Operator:** You (the adult setting this up)

- All decision authority rests with founding operator
- You invest capital, build systems, take risk
- Youth workers are paid members but don't govern yet
- Simple, fast, appropriate for startup phase

**Transition trigger:** When 3+ youth workers are active for 6+ months

### Phase 2: Advisory Board

- Founding operator + 2-3 youth representatives
- Youth advise on operations, scheduling, pricing
- Operator retains final decision authority
- Prepares youth for governance responsibility

**Transition trigger:** When revenue exceeds $10k/year or 5+ active workers

### Phase 3: Democratic Co-op

- 1 member = 1 vote on major decisions
- Elected board handles day-to-day
- Members vote on: pricing, new services, equipment over $500, bylaws changes
- Founding operator becomes one vote among many (or advisory role)

---

## Roles

### Founding Operator (You)

- Infrastructure setup and maintenance
- Training and supervision
- Accounting and compliance
- Customer acquisition systems
- Equipment purchasing
- Rate: $50/hr consulting (paid by co-op when revenue allows)

### Youth Workers

- Collection routes
- Composting operations
- Customer service
- Sales (with training)
- Rate: $50+/hr effective (varies by task efficiency)

### Customers/Members

- Provide materials (food waste, cardboard, yard waste)
- Pay subscription ($25/mo or $250/yr)
- Receive compost giveback (10 gal/year)
- No governance rights (they're customers, not worker-members)

---

## Legal Path

### Now: Informal / DBA

- File DBA ("Doing Business As") in Michigan: ~$20
- Operate under your name with a business alias
- Simple, start immediately
- You're personally liable (mitigate with waivers + homeowner's insurance check)

### Later: Formal Co-op

When revenue justifies paperwork:

1. **Michigan Cooperative Corporations Act** - file Articles of Incorporation
2. **Draft bylaws** - governance, membership, profit distribution
3. **EIN** - get federal tax ID
4. **Bank account** - in co-op's name
5. **Insurance** - general liability policy

Estimated cost: $200-500 in filing fees, or ~$1000 with lawyer review

### Alternative: Fiscal Sponsorship

Partner with existing 501(c)(3) nonprofit:
- They provide legal/tax umbrella
- Their insurance covers your activities
- You keep 90-95% of funds
- Good for receiving grants or tax-deductible donations
- 5-10% admin fee

Potential sponsors:
- Local community foundations
- Environmental nonprofits
- MSU Extension / 4-H programs
- Land trusts
- Churches with community gardens

## Insurance & Liability

### Risks

| Risk | Scenario | Protection |
|------|----------|------------|
| Worker injury on your property | Kid hurts themselves with pitchfork | Homeowner's insurance (check policy) + parent waiver |
| Worker injury on customer property | ATV accident during delivery | General liability policy (~$400/yr) |
| Property damage | Mower hits fence | General liability |
| Product liability | "Your compost killed my tomatoes" | General liability (rare claims) |

### Minimum Viable Protection

1. **Check homeowner's policy** - many cover "incidental business" up to $X
2. **Parent waivers** - for all youth workers
3. **Customer service agreements** - liability acknowledgment
4. **General liability** - when doing lawn work on others' property (~$30-50/mo)

---

## Decision Framework

### Operator Decides (Phase 1-2)

- Equipment purchases
- Pricing
- Route design
- Customer acceptance
- Worker training requirements
- Safety rules

### Members Vote (Phase 3)

- Pricing changes
- New service offerings
- Equipment purchases over $500
- Bylaw amendments
- Admission of new members
- Distribution of surplus profits

### Always Require Consensus

- Safety policy changes
- Removal of a member
- Dissolution of co-op

---

## Profit Distribution

After paying:
1. Operating expenses (fuel, supplies, insurance)
2. Equipment maintenance/replacement fund (10% of revenue)
3. Worker payments (hourly rate × hours worked)

Remaining surplus distributed:
- 50% to workers (proportional to hours worked)
- 30% to equipment/growth fund
- 20% to founding operator (infrastructure maintenance)

Percentages adjustable by member vote in Phase 3.

---

## Exit / Dissolution

If co-op dissolves:
1. Pay all outstanding debts
2. Return customer deposits (if any)
3. Sell equipment, distribute proceeds to members by hours worked
4. Remaining assets donated to local environmental nonprofit

No member can "sell their share" - this is a worker co-op, not an investment.
